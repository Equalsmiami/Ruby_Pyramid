#Pyramid Generator
> This small ruby program allows for a single user input. 
Which is translated to a pyramid represented by asteriks.
The program evenly adds spaces to both the left and right side of the pyramids to create a pointy pyramid.

*Note:* This Program only works with smaller numbers if you insert a large number the pyramid does not a build neatly.
However, it will still build an asymmetrical pyramid.
